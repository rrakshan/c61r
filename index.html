    <h1> About Me</h1>
<div span id="line"></div>
    <p>
        I am a student who lives in Madurai with my family. All my friends are from the city too.  I always try to be myself, be passionate about my dreams, live honestly, and work hard to achieve all that I want to make. I like watching cartoons, and my favorite cartoon character is Sinchan. My hobbies are watching movies, drawing and listening to music. I have always wanted to be a scientist and serve the society how much ever I could.

            My hobby is drawing. I love to draw with different colours. Drawing gives me happiness. My most favourite time is when I come back from school because at that time I get free time to paint.
            I love to draw pokemon pictures on my notebook. They are my favourite drawings. My mother motivates me to draw more and more. In my school also, everyone loves my drawings.
            My mother and father always help me in getting coloured pencils, sketch pens etc. They become very happy because I do not waste time and do my drawing in free time. </p>

       I consider Dr.APJ Abdul Kalam as the most inspiring person in my life. He was a great scientist and was the 11th president of India. His life story is really inspiring for me. APJ Abdul Kalam was born on 15th October 1931. He was born and brought up in Rameswaram, Tamilnadu. He has reached heights even after being born and brought up in a small village.

   He started his career as a scientist in Defense research and development organization. He worked under the great leadership of Vikram Sarabhai and was later transferred to ISRO.
 Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was not only awarded and honored by Indian organization and committees but also by many international organizations and committees. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was a man of simplicity and integrity.
